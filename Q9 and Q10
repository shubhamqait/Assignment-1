Q9 What will be the output of the following Python code?
	def foo(x):
		x[0] = ['def']
		x[1] = ['abc']
		return id(x)
	q = ['abc', 'def']
	print(id(q) == foo(q))
Sol:-  Output is True.

Q10 What will be the output of the following Python code and explain how?
	['true', 'false'][bool('SPAM')]
  Sol:-  Output is ‘false’ because in [bool(‘SPAM’)] it gives true which means 1. So in this [‘true’,’false’] bool(‘SPAM’) function take index 1 value which is ‘false’.
