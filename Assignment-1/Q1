Q1) Explain:
a. The negative index in Python
b. How can you generate random numbers in Python?
c. The use of // operator in Python
d. The iterators, decorators, and generators in Python
e. The difference between list and tuple

Sol:-
a) The negative index in python is used for indexing last element as -1 and second last element as -2 and so on. This is useful when you don’t know the last index value and you want to access without calculating the length of arrays(list,tuple,set,dict) in python.

b) This is possible by using the predefined function which is random.randrange(starting number,end number) and import the library random.

c) // this is called floor division method operator and it is used to give result nearest to whole number.

d) Iterators-Iterator in python is any python type that can be used with a ‘for in loop’. Python lists, tuples, dicts and sets are all examples of inbuilt iterators.

Decorators-A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

Generators- it include two terms function and object:
  1)Generators Function-A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
  2)Generator Object-Generator functions return a generator object. Generator objects are used either by calling the next method on the generator object or using the generator object in a “for in” loop.

e) The main difference between lists and a tuples is the fact that lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable.
